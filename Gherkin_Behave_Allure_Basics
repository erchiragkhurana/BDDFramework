Scenario Outline: Login by customer #Scenario outline is for test driven wherein you have to gie examples
                  When user enter username <username>
                  And user enter password <password>
                  And user click on sign up button
                  Then user should be login successfully

1. just write behave in terminal and enter
2. behave --tags=smoke, is used to run only smoke tagged scenarios
3. behave --tags=smoke,abcd to execute two test cases
4. behave --tagse=smoke --tags=sanity, this is kind of and only 1 test case will execute which have both tags
